### Run the Script by hand
To run the script once, you can use the command
```bash
python3 aprsnotify.py
```
in the directory where you have the script's files. When you run this manually, you will see the latest packet you sent sent to your bot account on whatever network you are using.

### Find current release number
To find the current version of the script, run the following command (NOTE: This only works in Release 01212022 or higher):
```bash
python3 aprsnotify.py version
```
This will print the current release version to the screen.
