PLEASE READ THIS FIRST!

This utility will help you to configure the APRSNotify configuration file for the APRSNotify Bot Script. 

Please follow the directions found in the README at https://github.com/n8acl/aprsnotify in order to obtain the 
API keys you will need for this script.

When this utility is finished, the setup.py file will be renamed to setup.txt to prevent running the script again accidently. If this utility
needs to be run again in the future, just rename the setup.txt file to setup.py and run APRSNotify again.

You can also edit the config.py file directly. Instructions are included in that file if edits need to be made.
